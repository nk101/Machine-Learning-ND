\# Capstone Project
-------------------

**Problem Statement** This project will use the Stacking Mechanism and
weighted ensemble model to predict the Molecule from its chemical
properties. This project is heavily influenced from kaggle scripts for
Weighted ensemble and Stacking Mechanism
training dataset : train.csv
testing dataset :test.csv
Stacking output(1st model):submission.csv
Weighted Ensemble output:(2nd model): submissionensemble.csv
To calculate private leaderboard score, SUBMIT the above two files on following link
https://www.kaggle.com/c/bioresponse/leaderboard
Private leaderboard score for Stacking:for 3 iterations I obtained a private leaderboard scores of 0.37564,0.37777,0.37559 (ranking lies between 7th to 15th)
Private leaderboard score for Weighted Ensemble: The score lies around 0.397658 ranking 150 to 170 on private leaderboard.
**Libraries**
pandas ,numpy, matplotlib, GradientBoostingClassifier,RandomForestClassifier,ExtraTreesClassifier,StratifiedKFold,LogisticRegression from sklearn.

**Dataset** The dataset can be downloaded from following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/bioresponse/data Download train.csv and
test.csv and extract into folder of your choice Set the directory in
Ipython Notebook of your folder

**Scripts and Information Links** A single Ipython notebook is divided
into two sections 1)Predictions using Stacking Mechanism 2)Predictions
using weighted Ensemble model. For first approach,
